## Why Verification is Required

US wireless carriers require all toll-free numbers used for SMS/MMS to complete verification. This protects consumers from spam and ensures legitimate businesses can reach their customers.

**What to expect:**
- Verification typically takes 1-5 business days
- You'll receive email updates on your status
- Once approved, you can immediately send to US/Canada numbers

## Step 1: Business Information

### Business Name
Enter your **legal business name** exactly as registered with your government.

**Good examples:**
- Acme Corporation Inc.
- Smith & Associates LLC
- TechStart Solutions Ltd

**Avoid:**
- Nicknames or abbreviations (use "International Business Machines" not "IBM")
- Marketing names that differ from legal name

### Doing Business As (DBA) - Optional
If you operate under a different name than your legal name, enter it here.

**Example:** Legal name "John Smith Enterprises LLC" but you operate as "QuickShip Delivery"

### Website
Enter your business website URL including https://

**Requirements:**
- Must be a live, accessible website
- Should clearly show your business name
- Must match the business you're registering

**Good:** https://www.acmecorp.com

## Step 4: Message Details

This is the most important section. Be specific and honest.

### Use Case Category
Select the category that best describes your messaging:

| Category | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| 2FA | Login codes, password resets, security alerts |
| App Notifications | In-app alerts, status updates |
| Appointments | Reminders, confirmations, rescheduling |
| Order Notifications | Shipping updates, delivery alerts |
| Account Notifications | Balance alerts, payment confirmations |
| Customer Service | Support responses, ticket updates |
| Marketing | Promotions, sales, newsletters |

### Use Case Description
Explain **specifically** what messages you'll send and why.

**Good example:**
"We send appointment reminders to patients 24 hours before their scheduled
dental appointments. Messages include the appointment date, time, dentist
name, and office address. Patients can reply YES to confirm or call our
office to reschedule."

**Bad example:**
"We send messages to customers."

**What to include:**
- WHO receives messages (customers, patients, subscribers)
- WHAT the messages contain (reminders, codes, alerts)
- WHEN messages are sent (triggers, frequency)
- WHY recipients want these messages (value proposition)

### Sample Messages
Provide 1-3 realistic examples of messages you'll send.

**Good examples:**

"Hi Sarah, this is a reminder of your appointment with Dr. Johnson tomorrow
at 2:30 PM. Reply YES to confirm or call (555) 123-4567 to reschedule."

"Your order #12345 has shipped! Track your package: https://acme.co/track/12345
Expected delivery: Dec 15. Reply STOP to opt out."

"Your verification code is 847291. This code expires in 10 minutes.
Don't share this code with anyone."

**What makes a good sample:**
- Realistic content (not "test message")
- Includes opt-out info for marketing (STOP)
- Shows actual use case
- Professional tone

### Message Volume
Select your estimated monthly message volume:
- 10 - Just starting out
- 100 - Small business
- 1,000 - Growing business
- 10,000 - Established business
- 100,000+ - High volume

**Tip:** Be realistic. Starting with a lower volume and scaling up is fine.

## Step 5: Opt-In Workflow

This section proves you have permission to message people. **This is where most rejections happen.**

### What is Opt-In?
Opt-in means your recipients have explicitly agreed to receive SMS messages from you. This is legally required (TCPA compliance).

### Describe Your Opt-In Process

**Good example:**
"Users opt-in during account registration on our website. On the signup form,
there is a checkbox (unchecked by default) that says 'I agree to receive
SMS notifications about my orders. Message and data rates may apply.
Reply STOP to unsubscribe.' Users must check this box to enable SMS.
We store the timestamp and IP address of consent."

**Bad example:**
"Users sign up on our website."

### Opt-In Methods by Use Case

**E-commerce / Order Updates:**
"During checkout, customers enter their phone number and check a box agreeing
to receive shipping and delivery updates via SMS. The checkbox text reads:
'Send me SMS updates about my order (optional). Msg & data rates may apply.
Reply STOP to opt out.'"

**Appointment Reminders:**
"When booking an appointment online or in-person, patients provide their mobile
number and sign a consent form that includes: 'I authorize [Business Name] to
send appointment reminders via text message. Standard message rates apply.
Text STOP to cancel.'"

**2FA / Security Codes:**
"Users enable two-factor authentication in their account settings. They enter
their phone number and verify it by entering a code we send. By completing
verification, they consent to receive security codes at that number."

**Marketing / Promotions:**
"Customers text JOIN to our shortcode or enter their number on our website
popup. They receive a confirmation message: 'Thanks for subscribing to
Acme deals! ~4 msgs/month. Reply HELP for help, STOP to cancel. Msg&data
rates may apply.' They must reply YES to confirm."

### Opt-In Proof (Screenshots)

Upload screenshots showing your opt-in process:
- Website signup form with SMS consent checkbox
- Mobile app permission screen
- Paper consent form
- Text message opt-in confirmation

**Tips:**
- Highlight the consent checkbox/text
- Show the full context (not just cropped checkbox)
- Include your business name in the screenshot
- PNG or JPG format, under 10MB

---

## Step 6: Compliance URLs

### Privacy Policy URL
Link to your privacy policy that explains how you handle personal data including phone numbers.

**Must include:**
- What data you collect (including phone numbers)
- How you use the data (including SMS messaging)
- How users can opt out
- Contact information

### Terms of Service URL
Link to your terms and conditions.
